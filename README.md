Laravel Pablo has been created to speed up MY workflow.
So it can do it for you too.

1-- /******************* INIT **********************/

Once you composer required it
you can use

php artisan laravelpablo:init

this function has different modes.
write 

php artisan laravelpablo:init --help 

for informations.

2-- /***************** RESOURCES ********************/

Once you created your php artisan make:model User -crm

You can use

php artisan laravelpablo:resources

to spice it up 
(generate blades, fix the controller and add into it the famous function ajaxLoadList, generate it's .js file and so on.)
